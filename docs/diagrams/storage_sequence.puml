== Startup: construct app and load saved data ==
User -> Ui : open app / console
Ui -> App : start()
App -> Storage : load()
alt file exists & non-empty
    Storage -> File : read all lines
    Storage -> Storage : parse lines (ATHLETE / SESSION / EXERCISE)
    Storage -> Coach : create athletes/sessions/exercises
    Storage -> Storage : fix id counters (session/exercise)
    Storage --> App : return Coach (populated)
else file missing or empty
    Storage --> App : return empty Coach
end
App -> Ui : showWelcome()
App -> Ui : print("Loaded saved athletes data." or "No saved data")

== Runtime: user command -> save ==
loop for each user command
    User -> Ui : type command
    Ui --> App : get input
    App -> Parser : parse(...)  -> Command
    Parser --> App : Command instance
    App -> Command : execute(coach, ui)
    alt execute successful
        Command -> Coach : mutate model
        App -> Storage : save(coach)
        Storage -> File : overwrite and write ATHLETE/SESSION/EXERCISE lines
        Storage --> App : save completed
    else parse/execute fails
        App -> Ui : print error
        note right: save() not called on failure
    end
end

note over Storage,File
  Exceptions and IO errors are intentionally omitted from the
  sequence for clarity; mention them in the DG text.
