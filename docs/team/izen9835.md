## Overview

### Project: FitnessONE

FitnessONE is a desktop fitness tracking application designed for personal trainers to manage multiple athletes and their workout sessions. The user interacts with it using a CLI (Command Line Interface). It is written in Java, and has about 10 kLoC.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

### Features Implemented

* **New Feature: New Athlete Command**
  * **What it does:** Allows the user to create a new athlete profile with a specified name. The system automatically generates a unique 4-digit athlete ID.
  * **Justification:** This is a core feature essential for the application as trainers need to register new athletes before tracking their workouts.
  * **Highlights:** The implementation includes input validation to ensure athlete names are not empty and proper error handling for edge cases.
  * **Related:** `NewAthleteCommand.java`

* **New Feature: Delete Athlete Command**
  * **What it does:** Allows the user to delete an athlete and all associated workout data by providing the athlete's 4-digit ID.
  * **Justification:** Trainers need the ability to remove athletes who are no longer active, including all their historical data.
  * **Highlights:** This feature includes confirmation warnings and cascading deletion of all sessions and exercises associated with the athlete. Implementation required careful consideration of data integrity.
  * **Related:** `DeleteAthleteCommand.java`

* **New Feature: Robust Storage System**
  * **What it does:** Implements a comprehensive file-based storage system that persists athlete, session, and exercise data between application runs. Includes detailed error detection and reporting for corrupted data.
  * **Justification:** Data persistence is critical for a real-world application. The robust error handling ensures that minor data corruption doesn't result in complete data loss.
  * **Highlights:** 
    * Implements per-line parsing with detailed diagnostics that report line numbers and specific errors
    * Validates all IDs against strict formatting rules (athlete: 4 digits, session: 3 digits, exercise: 2 digits)
    * Gracefully handles malformed data by skipping invalid entries while loading valid ones
    * Automatically fixes ID counters to prevent future collisions
    * Uses pipe-delimited format with proper escaping for special characters
  * **Related:** `StorageManager.java`

### Enhancements to Existing Features

* **Overall OOP Structure:** Established the foundational architecture using proper separation of concerns:
  * Created the Command pattern implementation for all user commands
  * Designed the Model layer (`Athlete`, `Session`, `Exercise`) with clear responsibilities
  * Implemented the Controller layer (`Coach`) to manage business logic
  * Separated UI and parsing concerns into dedicated classes
  * Established clear interfaces between components to enable independent testing and future extensions

* **Error Handling Framework:** Implemented custom exception hierarchy (`InvalidAthleteException`, `InvalidSessionException`, `InvalidExerciseException`) to provide clear error messages to users

### Documentation

* **User Guide:**
  * Added documentation for athlete management features
  * Provided clear examples and usage patterns for new athlete and delete athlete commands

* **Developer Guide:**
  * Documented the storage system architecture and file format
  * Added sequence diagrams for storage operations
  * Detailed the error handling and recovery mechanisms

### Project Management

* Set up initial project structure and build configuration
* Established coding standards and checkstyle configurations
* Created robust storage format specification for team collaboration

### Community

* Reviewed PRs and provided feedback to team members
* Helped debug storage-related issues encountered by teammates
* Contributed to team discussions on architecture decisions
