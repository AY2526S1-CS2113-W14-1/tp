## Design

### Architecture Overview

The diagram below provides a comprehensive view of FitnessONE's architecture and class interactions:

![Overall Architecture](diagrams/overall_UML.png)

### UI Component

The UI component handles all user interaction through a command-line interface (CLI). It serves as the primary interface between the user and the system.

#### Responsibilities
- Provide a command-line interface (CLI) for user interaction
- Read raw user input, display formatted output and error messages
- Delegate input parsing to `seedu.fitnessone.ui.Parser`
- Forward parsed commands to the Logic component and display command results
- UI does not contain business logic; it only formats input/output and handles presentation concerns

#### Key Classes
- `seedu.fitnessone.ui.Parser` — converts raw input strings to command objects and validates basic syntax
- `Ui` / `TextUi` — reads input from stdin, prints to stdout, and formats messages
- Any `Message` or `UiStrings` class — centralises user-facing strings and error messages

#### Input Processing Flow
1. UI reads input and passes it to `Parser.parse(...)`
2. Parser creates a Command object which is passed to the Logic component
3. For invalid input or domain errors (e.g. `InvalidAthleteException`), UI catches exceptions and prints user-friendly messages:
```
Error: Athlete not found - 0001
Caused by: seedu.fitnessone.exception.InvalidAthleteException: Invalid Athlete ID: 0001
```

#### UI Design Principles
1. **Consistent Formatting**
   ```
   Input:  /viewAhlete 0001
   Output: Showing athlete 0001: <name> — <summary>
   Error:  Error: Athlete not found - 0001
   ```

2. **Quality Assurance**
   - Unit tests for Parser and UI formatting methods
   - Checkstyle compliance
   - End-to-end acceptance tests for input/output behavior

3. **Design Considerations**
   - Minimal UI code to isolate presentation changes from logic
   - Centralized user strings for easier message updates and translations



### Program Flow

#### Main Execution Loop

![Main program loop](diagrams/main_loop.png)

The sequence diagram above shows how FitnessONE processes commands in its main loop, from user input through execution and persistence.

#### Storage Operations

![Storage sequence diagram](diagrams/storage_sequence.png)

This diagram illustrates the data persistence flow, showing startup loading and per-command saving operations.

## Product scope

Product name: FitnessONE

### Target user profile

FitnessONE is designed for professional fitness coaches who need a compact, scriptable CLI tool to manage and monitor multiple students' training routines and nutrition. Typical users:

- Individual coaches running small teams or classes
- Strength & conditioning coaches tracking sessions and macros
- Coaches who prefer lightweight CLI tools and version-controlled data

Formatting and examples
- Keep prompts and responses simple and consistent. Example interaction:
    - Input: `/viewAthlete 0001`
    - Output: `Showing athlete 0001: <name> — <summary>`
    - Error: `Error: Athlete not found - 0001`

FitnessONE provides coaches an efficient, data-driven platform for exercise logging, macronutrient tracking, and automatic recommendations for diets and exercises. It is simple to use and integrates persistent storage so coaches can generate progress reports and plan long-term training efficiently.

### Key features (current / planned)

- Track athletes (create, view, update athlete records)
- Track training sessions per athlete (notes, completed flag)
- Track exercises within sessions (description, sets, reps, completed)
- Track macronutrients (protein/carbs/fats) per athlete and per day (planned)
- Recommend diet plans and exercise suggestions based on logged data (planned)
- Persistent storage to `data/athletes_export.txt` (load on startup, save after successful commands)
- Import/export and round-trip loading for reproducible testing

### Brainstorming and references

- Week 5 brainstorming notes (planning and options considered): https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1CCIecnaanB5N0eg2bsRAJShKHbCECX9t7Hzhew0F9aI/edit?usp=sharing
- Input model options considered:
	- Predetermined plans (pre-built programs coaches can assign)
	- Fully user-input exercises (coach enters exercise name, sets, reps, weight)

### Non-goals (out of scope for current release)

- Real-time sync across devices or multi-user concurrent editing
- Complex GUI client (this is a CLI-first tool)


Design notes
- Keep UI code minimal so changes to presentation do not affect logic.
- Centralise all user strings to make updating messages and translations easier.

|Version| As a ... | I want to ... | So that I can ...|
|--------|----------|---------------|------------------|
|v1.0|coach|create and manage athlete records; add training sessions and exercises; log daily macronutrients|track each student's training and nutrition data and preserve session history|
|v2.0|coach|receive diet and exercise recommendations; export/import athlete data|adapt plans automatically based on tracked data and share/archive team progress|

## Implementation

## Testing

Testing will ensure the correctness, reliability, and stability of FitnessOne. The project uses JUnit (version 5) for automated testing and manual verification of the user-facing behavior.

Our methods combine:
- Unit testing for core logic (e.g., Parser, Coach, Command classes).
- Integration testing for features that involve multiple components.
- System testing for end-to-end behavior using the CLI interface. Running Tests

Tests can be automatically executed using Gradle:

```
./gradlew clean test
```
The build itself will fail if any test fails.
In order to open a full report use:
```
build/reports/tests/test/index.html
```

you can also access specific test cases:
```
./gradlew test --tests seedu.fitnessone.command.NewSessionCommandTest
```

### Tests
For the tests themselves we split them up first of all in different components to ensure as full coverage as possible.

- Unit tests
  - Model tests (AthleteTest, SessionTest, ExerciseTest) to ensure data integrity and correct state updating.
  - Controller tests (CoachTest) which verify coordination between model objects and correct exception propagation.
  - Command tests (NewAthleteCommandTest, DeleteSessionCommandTest...): to check user input parsing, command execution, and outputs. 
  - Parser test: confirming valid/invalid command strings if they are correctly interpreted which are vital to the correct functionality.

- Integration test, to verify collaboration between logic and model layers. Thus ensuring data consistency across components:
  - Creating a new athlete and session (NewAthleteCommand + NewSessionCommand).
  - Adding and deleting exercises via the Coach controller.

- System Tests (CLI), testing the full command lifecycle, from user input to UI output.
  - System tests simulate user workflows end-to-end:
  ```Adding an athlete``` -> ```adding a session``` -> ```adding an exercise``` -> ```deleting it```
  - Handling invalid inputs and ensuring helpful error messages are displayed

### Notes
Copy-paste commands one by one to verify command parsing and UI responses.
You need not test every invalid variation—just ensure at least one invalid example per command behaves correctly.

## Instructions for Manual Testing (storage)

This appendix provides a short path a tester can follow to verify the storage feature (startup load and save-on-command).

1. Start with a fresh/known state:
	- If you already have a `data/athletes_export.txt` file, back it up or delete it to observe creation from scratch.

2. Run the application (from project root):

```
./gradlew run
```

3. Verify startup behaviour:
	- With no `data/athletes_export.txt`: observe the welcome message and the printed fallback message ("No saved data found, starting with empty data.").
	- With an existing file containing saved data: the app should report "Loaded saved athletes data." and the athletes/sessions/exercises should be accessible via view commands.

4. Test save-on-command:
	- Add an athlete using the appropriate command (see User Guide). For example (copy-paste):
	  - `addAthlete A01 John Doe`  (replace with actual command used in the app)
	- Add a session/exercise for that athlete.
	- Exit the application using the `exit` command.
	- Confirm that `data/athletes_export.txt` was created/updated and contains lines starting with `ATHLETE|`, `SESSION|`, `EXERCISE|`.

5. Test load-on-startup round-trip:
	- Restart the application.
	- Confirm the previously added athlete and sessions are present.

6. Edge checks:
	- Make sure multi-line notes are preserved across save/load (newlines are escaped as `\n` on save and restored on load).
	- Confirm that saving overwrites the data file (it does not append duplicate entries for the same runtime state).

If any of the above steps fail, capture the console output and the contents of `data/athletes_export.txt` and file an issue with those artifacts.

#### Use Case: Persist and Restore Coach Data

MSS

1. The user executes actions that modify the coach’s data (e.g. adding athletes, sessions, exercises)
2. The System (FitnessONE) calls StorageManager’s save() method to persist the data to file
3. Data is written in a structured, line-based format
4. When the application starts (or user requests a reload), the System calls StorageManager’s load() method
5. StorageManager parses the file and reconstructs all Coach, Athlete, Session, and Exercise objects in memory, restoring the full application state

Extensions

2a. The data file does not exist yet
 2a1. StorageManager creates any necessary folders and returns an empty Coach

2b. The file exists but is empty
 2b1. StorageManager loads an empty Coach

4a. The file is malformed (incorrect ID length/type, missing fields, parsing error)
 4a1. StorageManager records all parse errors, displays them (stderr), and attempts to recover or skip problematic lines

4b. Some IDs are duplicated or invalid
 4b1. StorageManager skips faulty records and proceeds with valid ones only

5a. The final loaded data is inconsistent (e.g., missing athlete/session/exercise IDs)
 5a1. StorageManager asserts and logs errors, but the app remains operational if possible


### Non-Functional Requirements

#### 1. Performance
* FitnessONE should respond to user commands within **few** under normal usage
* The system should handle up to **9999 athletes**, **999 sessions per athletes**, and **99 exercises per session**
* File read/write operations (saving and loading) should complete within **few seconds**

#### 2. Reliability
* Data should be automatically saved after every major operation (e.g., adding/deleting athletes, sessions, exercises)

#### 3. Compatibility
* FitnessONE must run on any operating system with **Java 17 or higher** installed.
* It should work consistently across **Windows, macOS, and Linux**.

#### 4. Usability
* Commands should follow a consistent CLI syntax and argument order.
* Error messages must clearly explain what went wrong and how to fix it.
* Leaderboards and progress summaries should be easy to read and interpret quickly.

#### 5. Maintainability
* The codebase must remain modular — each component (UI, Logic, Model, Storage) should be independently testable.
* All public classes and methods must include concise Javadoc comments describing their purpose and behavior.

#### 6. Extensibility
* New commands or data types should be implementable without modifying core logic, following the Command pattern.
* The modular architecture should allow easy integration of new features such as export, or performance analytics.

#### 7. Security
* File operations should be restricted to FitnessONE's working directory to prevent unauthorized access.
* Deserialization must reject malformed or unexpected input to ensure application safety.

#### 8. Portability
* The application must be distributable as a single standalone `.jar` file with no external dependencies.
* All file paths should be relative, ensuring consistent behavior across machines.

#### 9. Testing Coverage
* Each component should achieve at least **90% unit test coverage**.
* Core features (Add/Delete athletes, sessions, exercises, leaderboard) must include valid JUnit test cases.


### Glossary

**CLI (Command-Line Interface)**  
A text-based interface where users interact with FitnessONE by typing commands, instead of using a graphical interface. The CLI allows fast, efficient management of athletes, sessions, and exercises.

**Coach / Fitness Coach**  
The primary user of FitnessONE. Coaches create, manage, and track athletes, their sessions, and exercises. They also monitor performance using leaderboards and flagging.

**Athlete**  
An individual whose training is tracked within FitnessONE. Each athlete has a unique ID, a list of sessions, exercises, notes, and can be flagged for priority tracking.

**Session**  
A structured workout or training period assigned to an athlete. Sessions contain exercises, notes, completion status, and can be added, updated, completed, or deleted.

**Exercise**  
A specific activity within a session. Exercises have details like name, sets, reps, and completion status. They can be added, viewed, completed, undone, or deleted.

**Leaderboard**  
A ranking of athletes based on performance metrics, such as completed sessions and exercises. Coaches can view leaderboards to monitor progress and motivate athletes.

**Flagging**  
A visual priority system where athletes are assigned colors (e.g., red, yellow, green, blue) to indicate training urgency or performance level.

**Persistence / Save & Load**  
Functionality that allows all athletes, sessions, and exercises to be saved to a file and later restored. This ensures data continuity and eliminates the need to re-enter information.

**Command**  
A specific instruction entered by the user via the CLI to perform actions like adding an athlete, completing an exercise, or viewing the leaderboard.

**ID (Identifier)**  
A unique code assigned to each athlete, session, and exercise. IDs ensure accurate referencing and tracking across the system.

**Completion / Undo**  
Actions that allow marking sessions or exercises as completed, and optionally undoing them to correct mistakes.

**Help Menu**  
A CLI feature that lists all available commands and their usage, helping users understand how to interact with the system efficiently.

**StorageManager**  
The component responsible for persisting and restoring data. It handles saving/loading athlete profiles, sessions, exercises, and leaderboard information, ensuring data integrity.
